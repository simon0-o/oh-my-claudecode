/**
 * CLI-worker output contract (Option E, plan AC-7).
 *
 * When a /team critic/reviewer stage is routed to an external CLI worker
 * (codex, gemini, or kimi), the worker is a one-shot process that cannot call
 * TaskUpdate directly. To surface a structured verdict back to the team
 * leader, the worker writes a JSON payload to a pre-agreed file path
 * before exit. The leader's worker-completion handler in runtime-v2 reads
 * the file and calls TaskUpdate with verdict metadata.
 *
 * Applies to roles in CONTRACT_ROLES (critic, code-reviewer,
 * security-reviewer, test-engineer) when the resolved provider is
 * `codex`, `gemini`, or `kimi`. Claude workers participate in team messaging
 * directly and do not use this contract.
